TensorFlow is an open-source software library for machine learning across a range of tasks. It is a system for building and training neural networks to detect and decipher patterns and correlations, analogous to (but not the same as) human learning and reasoning. It is used for both research and production at Google, often replacing its closed-source predecessor, DistBelief.

TensorFlow was developed by the Google Brain team for internal Google use. It was released under the Apache 2.0 open source license on November 9, 2015.
